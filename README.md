# Smart Apps
Smart Apps are applications built to interface with the Smart Manufacturing Innovation Platform and extend its built in functionality. They can be hosted within the platform or connect to it externally to read/write data through the context of the model. Due to the extensible nature of the platform, the possibilities are enormous. Here are some basic examples of Smarts Apps and some resources to inspire creators.

## Examples:
### Content Management System Modules
These Modules are examples of Smart Apps that are directly integrated into the platform through the CMS. They leverage the ThinkIQ UI components to create 'drag and drop' Modules that can be used to the create live web pages within the CMS that are Model aware. Their source lives [here](CMS-Modules) and can be mimicked to create Smart Apps that exist with the platform's CMS.

### Weather Station Library
This library is an example of the flexible and powerful choice of using libraries to create Smart Apps. These Apps are created within the Model itself and can be exported into other platform instances. See the detailed example [here](Weather-Station-Library).

### Stand-Alone Applications
Stand-Alone applications can are hosted outside of a platform instance but connect to it through its secure external APIs. These applications are excellent for solutions for third parties that want to integrate with the platform. See an example [here](https://github.com/ThinkIQ-Labs/SMIP-SMX-2022-Demos)
